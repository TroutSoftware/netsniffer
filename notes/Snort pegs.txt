Notes about snort pegs
----------------------

The words module and plugin are refering to the same thing in this text.

The pegs used in snort modules to keep track of data are summed over the different threads snort knows about, but only these, so a thread_local declaration should be used with care if your module is spawning its own threads.

On startup snort loads all modules wether or not they are in the active configuration.

After startup snort configures the plugins that are mentioned in the current configuration file(s).

After the initial configuration has completed, snort will reset all pegs in all modules.

If a configuration is changed, (including adding or removing plugin configurations) and a "reload" signal is sent to snort, there will be no additional reset done on pegs.
