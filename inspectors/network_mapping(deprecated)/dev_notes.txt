# Network Mapping Snort Inspector #
###################################

!!! DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT !!!

The purpose of the network mapping inspector is to get an overview of the network traffic, who is sending, receiving and which services are communicating.

Requirements:
*************

R10: Output must be written to a text file

R10.1: The output base filename must be configurable from the snort config file

R10.2: Rotation of the file should be configurable from the snort config file, e.g. the filename will be postfixed by a timestamp, and a max of 1,000,000 lines must be written before a new file is opened/created with the timestamp of the rotation, this repeats indefinitely - See R20.2 for an exception to this rule.

R20: The format of each line is specified as "[N|U] [IP:[PORT|-]|MAC] -> [IP:[PORT|-]|MAC] [service name|-]"

     N indicates the first entry for a given connection, and U that it's an update to a previous connection
     IP will either be the IPv4 or IPv6 address, if IPv6 it will be enclosed in square brackets "[]"

     Only if no IP address is available may the MAC address be output

R20.1: The service name will be what is indicated by snort in its given configuration, there can't be a delay of more than 30s before a line is written to the file, after snort has detected a given connection and informed the Network Mapping Inspector of it

R20.2: If multiple service names are given to a connection, they must be output directly after the initial connection, i.e. a new connection is started prefixed by "N", updates will immediately follow, with one update on each line, and each of these lines will be prefixed by "U" (Note, this holds true even if file rotation is in effect, i.e. the file can exceed the append length specified in R10.2)

R40: Any updates to a connection that is happening later that 10s after the initial indication of the connection to the inspector by snort may be ignored, but are not guarantied to be ignored as long as R20.2 is not violated

R50: Each inspector context caches no more than X connections before they are written to file, X is configurable from the config file

R50.1: If the cache max is reached the cache for that specific inspector context must be flushed (i.e. written to disk) in part or fully to make space for new entries



Note: all time indications above are best-effort e.g. deviations due to thread scheduling, file caches, inaccurate timers etc. are compliant with these requirements
