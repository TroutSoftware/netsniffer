!!! DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT !!!

The purpose of the DHCP monitor is to monitor network addresses in use, and raise alerts if anything uexpected is noticed.

Requirements:
*************

*TBD*


Random notes:
*************

rna is a user, not a provider of dhcp events

appid plugin, is the one semingly detecting dhcp and making the events

form documentation appid plugin depends on (not yet sure which, if any, are important for the dhcp):
 - stream5 (with tcp and udp enabled)
 - frag3 (enabled and configured)
 - http preprocessor (enabled and configured)

 Lua JIT version 2.0.2 must be installed, never versions are not tested.
