# DHCP Snort Inspector #
###################################

!!! DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT !!!

The purpose of the DHCP monitor is to monitor network addresses in use, and raise alerts if anything uexpected is noticed.

Requirements:
*************

*TBD*




Random notes:
*************

In order for the dhcp_monitor to work, it needs the functionallity of the appid inspector, which in turn needs the stream and stream_udp services

stream = { }
stream_udp = { }
appid = { }
dhcp_monitor = { }

-----

rna is a user, not a provider of dhcp events

appid plugin, is the one semingly detecting dhcp and making the events

form documentation appid plugin depends on (only stream with udp seem to be important for dhcp detection):
 - stream5 (with tcp and udp enabled)
 - frag3 (enabled and configured)
 - http preprocessor (enabled and configured)

 Lua JIT version 2.0.2 must be installed, never versions are not tested.

Questions
