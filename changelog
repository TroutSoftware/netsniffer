# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the versioning scheme follows the upstream Snort one: for each upstream release,
we add an increment number, e.g.: v3.2.0-trout~4 means:
 - base snort release v3.2.0
 - this module release 4
